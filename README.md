## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS & Bootstrap_
* _Javascript & jQuery_
* _NPM & Webpack_
* _LocationIQ API & Bike Index API_

## Description

_This little web application works by taking in the users zip code and a distance in miles around that zip code to check for stolen bikes using the Bike Index API. It then goes on to show an approximate map of the area of the zip code using LocationIQ and a list of up to 100 stolen bikes. The bikes have information on where they were what they look like and other data, along with a link to more information on the bike index site._

## Setup/Installation Requirements
